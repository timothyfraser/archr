This tutorial complements `02_stakeholder_package_setup.R` and unpacks the workshop on r package installation checklist. You will see how it advances the Stakeholder Analysis sequence while building confidence with base R and tidyverse tooling.

## Setup

- Ensure you have opened the `archr` project root (or set your working directory there) before running any code.
- Open the workshop script in RStudio so you can execute lines interactively with `Ctrl+Enter` or `Cmd+Enter`.
- Create a fresh R session to avoid conflicts with leftover objects from earlier workshops.

## Skills

- Navigate the script `02_stakeholder_package_setup.R` within the Stakeholder Analysis module.
- Connect the topic "R package installation checklist" to systems architecting decisions.
- Install any required packages highlighted with `install.packages()`.

## Application

### Step 1 – Install Packages

List of packages installed.

```{r step_01, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c(
  # data wrangling packages
  "dplyr", "readr", "tidyr", "stringr", "purrr", 
  # networks packages
  "igraph", "tidygraph", "ggraph", 
  # Visualization packages
  "ggplot2", "viridis", "ggpubr",
  # Optimization support packages
  "GA", "rmoo",
  # Modeling support packages
  "texreg", "broom",
  # Extra helper packages
  "gtools"))
```

## Learning Checks

**Learning Check 1.** How do you run the entire workshop script after you have stepped through each section interactively?

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

Use `source(file.path("workshops", "02_stakeholder_package_setup.R"))` from the Console or press the Source button while the script is active.

</details>

**Learning Check 2.** Why does the script begin by installing or loading packages before exploring the exercises?

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

Those commands make sure the required libraries are available so every subsequent code chunk runs without missing-function errors.
