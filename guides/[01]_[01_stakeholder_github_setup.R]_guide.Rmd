This tutorial complements `01_stakeholder_github_setup.R` and unpacks the workshop on github onboarding for course. You will see how it advances the Stakeholder Analysis sequence while building confidence with base R and tidyverse tooling.

## Setup

- Ensure you have opened the `archr` project root (or set your working directory there) before running any code.
- Open the workshop script in RStudio so you can execute lines interactively with `Ctrl+Enter` or `Cmd+Enter`.
- Create a fresh R session to avoid conflicts with leftover objects from earlier workshops.

## Skills

- Navigate the script `01_stakeholder_github_setup.R` within the Stakeholder Analysis module.
- Connect the topic "GitHub onboarding for course" to systems architecting decisions.
- Install any required packages highlighted with `install.packages()`.

## Application

1. Open `workshops/01_stakeholder_github_setup.R` in the Source pane and skim the header comments for context.
2. Set your working directory to the project root so relative paths such as `workshops/` resolve correctly.
3. Run any `install.packages()` lines once to make sure the dependencies exist on your machine.
4. When you are comfortable, run `source(file.path("workshops", "01_stakeholder_github_setup.R"))` or click Source to execute the full workshop.
5. Record key takeaways and questions in the Learning Checks section below.
