This tutorial complements `36_evaluation_tradespace_visuals.R` and unpacks the workshop on tradespace visualization techniques. You will see how it advances the Evaluation sequence while building confidence with base R and tidyverse tooling.

## Setup

- Ensure you have opened the `archr` project root (or set your working directory there) before running any code.
- Open the workshop script in RStudio so you can execute lines interactively with `Ctrl+Enter` or `Cmd+Enter`.
- Create a fresh R session to avoid conflicts with leftover objects from earlier workshops.

## Skills

- Navigate the script `36_evaluation_tradespace_visuals.R` within the Evaluation module.
- Connect the topic "Tradespace visualization techniques" to systems architecting decisions.
- Document observations from running each code block in your lab notebook.

## Application

### Step 1 – Review the Script

Read through the script and experiment with each line in the console.

```{r step_01, eval=FALSE}
# Script: 36_evaluation_tradespace_visuals.R
# Original: tutorial_tradespace_2.R
# Topic: Tradespace visualization techniques
# Section: Evaluation
# Developed by: Timothy Fraser, PhD
# tutorial_tradespace_2.R
# Yup! We skipped the number 2! 
# Don't worry - you didn't miss any content!
```

## Learning Checks

**Learning Check 1.** How do you run the entire workshop script after you have stepped through each section interactively?

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

Use `source(file.path("workshops", "36_evaluation_tradespace_visuals.R"))` from the Console or press the Source button while the script is active.

</details>
