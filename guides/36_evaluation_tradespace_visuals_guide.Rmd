This tutorial complements `36_evaluation_tradespace_visuals.R` and unpacks the workshop on tradespace visualization techniques. You will see how it advances the Evaluation sequence while building confidence with base R and tidyverse tooling.

## Setup

- Ensure you have opened the `archr` project root (or set your working directory there) before running any code.
- Open the workshop script in RStudio so you can execute lines interactively with `Ctrl+Enter` or `Cmd+Enter`.
- Create a fresh R session to avoid conflicts with leftover objects from earlier workshops.

## Skills

- Navigate the script `36_evaluation_tradespace_visuals.R` within the Evaluation module.
- Connect the topic "Tradespace visualization techniques" to systems architecting decisions.
- Document observations from running each code block in your lab notebook.
