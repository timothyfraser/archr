This tutorial complements `40_evaluation_entropy_insights.R` and unpacks the workshop on entropy and tradespace insights. You will see how it advances the Evaluation sequence while building confidence with base R and tidyverse tooling.

## Setup

- Ensure you have opened the `archr` project root (or set your working directory there) before running any code.
- Open the workshop script in RStudio so you can execute lines interactively with `Ctrl+Enter` or `Cmd+Enter`.
- Create a fresh R session to avoid conflicts with leftover objects from earlier workshops.

## Skills

- Navigate the script `40_evaluation_entropy_insights.R` within the Evaluation module.
- Connect the topic "Entropy and tradespace insights" to systems architecting decisions.
- Practice tidyverse pipelines (`%>%`) to transform stakeholder or architecture tables.

## Application

1. Open `workshops/40_evaluation_entropy_insights.R` in the Source pane and skim the header comments for context.
2. Set your working directory to the project root so relative paths such as `workshops/` resolve correctly.
3. Execute each tidyverse pipeline slowly, pausing to read the intermediate tibbles that appear in the Console.
4. When you are comfortable, run `source(file.path("workshops", "40_evaluation_entropy_insights.R"))` or click Source to execute the full workshop.
5. Record key takeaways and questions in the Learning Checks section below.

## Learning Checks

**Learning Check 1.** How do you run the entire workshop script after you have stepped through each section interactively?

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

Use `source(file.path("workshops", "40_evaluation_entropy_insights.R"))` from the Console or press the Source button while the script is active.

</details>

**Learning Check 2.** What does the `%>%` pipeline operator help you accomplish in the worked examples?

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

It passes the intermediate tibble from one tidyverse verb to the next so you can express multi-step transformations clearly and avoid temporary variables.

</details>

**Learning Check 3.** In your own words, what key idea does the topic "Entropy and tradespace insights" reinforce?

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

It emphasizes how entropy and tradespace insights supports the overall systems architecting process in this course.
