This tutorial complements `17_enumeration_sampling_strategies.R` and unpacks the workshop on sampling strategies for architectures. You will see how it advances the Enumeration sequence while building confidence with base R and tidyverse tooling.

## Setup

- Ensure you have opened the `archr` project root (or set your working directory there) before running any code.
- Open the workshop script in RStudio so you can execute lines interactively with `Ctrl+Enter` or `Cmd+Enter`.
- Create a fresh R session to avoid conflicts with leftover objects from earlier workshops.

## Skills

- Navigate the script `17_enumeration_sampling_strategies.R` within the Enumeration module.
- Connect the topic "Sampling strategies for architectures" to systems architecting decisions.
- Load packages with `library()` and verify they attach without warnings.
- Practice tidyverse pipelines (`%>%`) to transform stakeholder or architecture tables.
- Leverage `apply` and `purrr` tools to evaluate many design alternatives in one step.

## Application

1. Open `workshops/17_enumeration_sampling_strategies.R` in the Source pane and skim the header comments for context.
2. Set your working directory to the project root so relative paths such as `workshops/` resolve correctly.
3. Load the libraries listed near the top of the script and confirm they attach without errors.
4. Execute each tidyverse pipeline slowly, pausing to read the intermediate tibbles that appear in the Console.
5. Review `apply` and `map` examples and try swapping in a different input vector to test yourself.
6. When you are comfortable, run `source(file.path("workshops", "17_enumeration_sampling_strategies.R"))` or click Source to execute the full workshop.
7. Record key takeaways and questions in the Learning Checks section below.

## Learning Checks

**Learning Check 1.** How do you run the entire workshop script after you have stepped through each section interactively?

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

Use `source(file.path("workshops", "17_enumeration_sampling_strategies.R"))` from the Console or press the Source button while the script is active.

</details>

**Learning Check 2.** Why does the script begin by installing or loading packages before exploring the exercises?

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

Those commands make sure the required libraries are available so every subsequent code chunk runs without missing-function errors.

</details>

**Learning Check 3.** What does the `%>%` pipeline operator help you accomplish in the worked examples?

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

It passes the intermediate tibble from one tidyverse verb to the next so you can express multi-step transformations clearly and avoid temporary variables.
