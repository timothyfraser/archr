This tutorial complements `00_pareto_rank_utilities.R` and unpacks the workshop on pareto ranking helpers. You will see how it advances the Evaluation sequence while building confidence with base R and tidyverse tooling.

## Setup

- Ensure you have opened the `archr` project root (or set your working directory there) before running any code.
- Open the workshop script in RStudio so you can execute lines interactively with `Ctrl+Enter` or `Cmd+Enter`.
- Create a fresh R session to avoid conflicts with leftover objects from earlier workshops.

## Skills

- Navigate the script `00_pareto_rank_utilities.R` within the Evaluation module.
- Connect the topic "Pareto ranking helpers" to systems architecting decisions.
- Define and call custom functions to encapsulate reusable logic.

## Application

1. Open `workshops/00_pareto_rank_utilities.R` in the Source pane and skim the header comments for context.
2. Set your working directory to the project root so relative paths such as `workshops/` resolve correctly.
3. Re-run the custom functions with your own arguments to observe how the outputs change.
4. When you are comfortable, run `source(file.path("workshops", "00_pareto_rank_utilities.R"))` or click Source to execute the full workshop.
5. Record key takeaways and questions in the Learning Checks section below.

## Learning Checks

**Learning Check 1.** How do you run the entire workshop script after you have stepped through each section interactively?

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

Use `source(file.path("workshops", "00_pareto_rank_utilities.R"))` from the Console or press the Source button while the script is active.

</details>

**Learning Check 2.** How can you verify that a custom function defined in the script behaves the way you expect?

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

Call the function with a simple input (for example the one used in the script) and print or view the returned value, then try a new input to see how the output changes.
