This tutorial complements `26_evaluation_system_reliability.R` and unpacks the workshop on system reliability evaluation. You will see how it advances the Evaluation sequence while building confidence with base R and tidyverse tooling.

## Setup

- Ensure you have opened the `archr` project root (or set your working directory there) before running any code.
- Open the workshop script in RStudio so you can execute lines interactively with `Ctrl+Enter` or `Cmd+Enter`.
- Create a fresh R session to avoid conflicts with leftover objects from earlier workshops.

## Skills

- Navigate the script `26_evaluation_system_reliability.R` within the Evaluation module.
- Connect the topic "System reliability evaluation" to systems architecting decisions.
- Load packages with `library()` and verify they attach without warnings.

## Application

1. Open `workshops/26_evaluation_system_reliability.R` in the Source pane and skim the header comments for context.
2. Set your working directory to the project root so relative paths such as `workshops/` resolve correctly.
3. Load the libraries listed near the top of the script and confirm they attach without errors.
4. When you are comfortable, run `source(file.path("workshops", "26_evaluation_system_reliability.R"))` or click Source to execute the full workshop.
5. Record key takeaways and questions in the Learning Checks section below.

## Learning Checks

**Learning Check 1.** How do you run the entire workshop script after you have stepped through each section interactively?

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

Use `source(file.path("workshops", "26_evaluation_system_reliability.R"))` from the Console or press the Source button while the script is active.

</details>

**Learning Check 2.** Why does the script begin by installing or loading packages before exploring the exercises?

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

Those commands make sure the required libraries are available so every subsequent code chunk runs without missing-function errors.

</details>

**Learning Check 3.** In your own words, what key idea does the topic "System reliability evaluation" reinforce?

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

It emphasizes how system reliability evaluation supports the overall systems architecting process in this course.
