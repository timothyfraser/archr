This tutorial complements `03_stakeholder_first_r_script.R` and unpacks the workshop on first r script practice. You will see how it advances the Stakeholder Analysis sequence while building confidence with base R and tidyverse tooling.

## Setup

- Ensure you have opened the `archr` project root (or set your working directory there) before running any code.
- Open the workshop script in RStudio so you can execute lines interactively with `Ctrl+Enter` or `Cmd+Enter`.
- Create a fresh R session to avoid conflicts with leftover objects from earlier workshops.

## Skills

- Navigate the script `03_stakeholder_first_r_script.R` within the Stakeholder Analysis module.
- Connect the topic "First R script practice" to systems architecting decisions.
- Document observations from running each code block in your lab notebook.

## Application

1. Open `workshops/03_stakeholder_first_r_script.R` in the Source pane and skim the header comments for context.
2. Set your working directory to the project root so relative paths such as `workshops/` resolve correctly.
3. When you are comfortable, run `source(file.path("workshops", "03_stakeholder_first_r_script.R"))` or click Source to execute the full workshop.
4. Record key takeaways and questions in the Learning Checks section below.

## Learning Checks
