This tutorial complements `14_enumeration_foundations.R` and unpacks the workshop on enumeration tutorial foundations. You will see how it advances the Enumeration sequence while building confidence with base R and tidyverse tooling.

## Setup

- Ensure you have opened the `archr` project root (or set your working directory there) before running any code.
- Open the workshop script in RStudio so you can execute lines interactively with `Ctrl+Enter` or `Cmd+Enter`.
- Create a fresh R session to avoid conflicts with leftover objects from earlier workshops.

## Skills

- Navigate the script `14_enumeration_foundations.R` within the Enumeration module.
- Connect the topic "Enumeration tutorial foundations" to systems architecting decisions.
- Load packages with `library()` and verify they attach without warnings.
- Import and export data files using `readr` helpers and inspect the results.
- Practice tidyverse pipelines (`%>%`) to transform stakeholder or architecture tables.

## Application

1. Open `workshops/14_enumeration_foundations.R` in the Source pane and skim the header comments for context.
2. Set your working directory to the project root so relative paths such as `workshops/` resolve correctly.
3. Load the libraries listed near the top of the script and confirm they attach without errors.
4. Walk through the data import and export chunks, using the Environment pane to inspect the created objects.
5. Execute each tidyverse pipeline slowly, pausing to read the intermediate tibbles that appear in the Console.
6. When you are comfortable, run `source(file.path("workshops", "14_enumeration_foundations.R"))` or click Source to execute the full workshop.
7. Record key takeaways and questions in the Learning Checks section below.

## Learning Checks

**Learning Check 1.** How do you run the entire workshop script after you have stepped through each section interactively?

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

Use `source(file.path("workshops", "14_enumeration_foundations.R"))` from the Console or press the Source button while the script is active.

</details>

**Learning Check 2.** Why does the script begin by installing or loading packages before exploring the exercises?

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

Those commands make sure the required libraries are available so every subsequent code chunk runs without missing-function errors.

</details>

**Learning Check 3.** Which helper do you use in this workshop to bring external data into R, and what should you check right after calling it?

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

Use the `readr` functions shown (such as `read_csv()` or `read_rds()`) and immediately inspect the resulting tibble in the Environment pane to confirm the columns loaded as expected.

</details>

**Learning Check 4.** What does the `%>%` pipeline operator help you accomplish in the worked examples?

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

It passes the intermediate tibble from one tidyverse verb to the next so you can express multi-step transformations clearly and avoid temporary variables.
